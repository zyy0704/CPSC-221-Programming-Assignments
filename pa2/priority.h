/*
* File:        priority.h
* Description: Defines a priority ordering structure specially made for determining the
*              order of neighbours visited in PA2's filler::fill function.
*              Note that this does NOT serve the same purpose as the stack/queue
*              ordering structure which you have also been asked to implement.
*
*              Ignoring resize costs, any single insertion or removal operation
*              should cost at most O(n), where n is the number of PixelPoints
*              stored in the collection.
*
*              You may add your own private functions to support the priority ordering of
*              the collection contents.
